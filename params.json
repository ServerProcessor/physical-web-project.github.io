More than 120 diferent proposals where received initially, than became 90 final proposals on the Google system.\r\nCongratulations to the choosen ones, and thank your to all the rest, your proposals were generally so interesting but finally we do have a very limited number of spots.\r\n\r\n**The GSoC Physical Web project mentor team.**\r\n\r\nOn 25.3.2016 Google system closed the window application for would be students.\r\nWe hope most of you have presented a final PDF and get the Complete flag on the GSoC system. Goog luck for everybody !\r\n\r\nOn 19.3.2016 a guide to Physical Web has been provided. [Please read this guide to Physical Web](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VC9umaw9TItV31WrcX0eJ9xVsfXXQoWvUjuSqWXmH8A/edit#).\r\n\r\nOn 14.3.2016 opened the registration period at GSoC site. We hope all of the students that have been contacting us apply to the system and fill up his data and project proposal. We'll be contacting you all ASAP, but remember that lots of students have contacted us and that all the communications from there will always happen through the GSoC portal in private or public way between mentors and students.\r\nSo, point your browser to [Main GSoC 2016 Site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and register when it's open. Good luck to all !!!\r\n\r\n### What is the Physical Web and the Physical Web Project?\r\nThe Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away. \r\n\r\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.\r\n\r\nThe Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What kinds of skills or experience should you bring?\r\n* Programming in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 or other languages.\r\n* Experience with Mobile environment, including Android.\r\n* Experience with Wireless development, including Bluetooth Low Energy.\r\n* Experience in small PC like systems such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Beagle Board.\r\n* Technical experience with other Internet of Things systems.\r\n\r\n### Suggested GSoC 2016 Project Ideas\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of great things you could work on, here are some briefly described and to be developed, but first take a look at the [ideas page](http://google.github.io/physical-web/cookbook/) from the main web site. \r\nAnd also remember that you can propose us with your ideas.\r\n\r\n* Person identifier for Emergency situations  \r\nIdea: In order to identify people in emergency or disaster situations (the beacon will link to a website with the user's health profile). The web has different profiles to show. -For normal people, police, or emergency people as a doctor or a nurse.\r\nTo be coded: A platform with users registration, tahta generates urls for the associated beacons running on a server, the frontend, the android aplication with login profile and link to liquid galaxy.  \r\nSkills needed: nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html, and android.\r\n\r\n* Smartphone Auto Setting  \r\nIdea: Useful to autoset a preselected settings on the phone. E.g. When a user arrives to a place, its smartphone reads a particular beacon and it starts the silent mode.  \r\nTo be coded: android app that automatically starts preselected settings on the phone\r\nSkills needed: Android  \r\n\r\n* Guide me for blind people  \r\nIdea: For people with visual problems, some beacons in the path could help to provide further information about the place or to check if it is the correct destination, it can help to ensure that the beacon provides extra information about the place until the next beacon (if there are obstacles, stairs, wide corridor, etc.)  \r\nTo be coded: Android app that detects different physical web beacons, check the distance and gives information via voice.\r\nSkills needed: nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html\r\n\r\n* Local Air & Weather Info  \r\nIdea: To check weather information or other open data information, when a user arrives to a place, the beacon can tell, temperature, level of air pollution, etc.  \r\nTo be coded: Android app that check a physical web beacon and gives relevant open data information with push notifications. Backend to set locations beacons and information.  \r\nSkills needed:  nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html\r\n\r\n* Interactive License Plate for Drones  \r\nIdea: Drones are gonna be everywhere soon moving goods, medicines, and many more things. As we have the right to know what’s going on over our heads, the idea is that every drone has a PW beacon pointing to an url with information about his trip. This web page has to be dynamically generated each time the drone departs from a place to another, and if it’s in the range of the BLE radio, the user will have different informations about the drone and his trip or a fixed virtual license plate.  \r\nTo be coded: The application has to deal with generating a backend for different users to register his drones, and have a link to a multi drone system. Also the front end consisting on a mobile site done in Polymer, Html5, or similar modern web languages with Material Design aspect.  \r\nSkills needed: Python.  \r\n\r\n* BYOP (Bring Your Own POIS)  \r\nIdea: The many Google Liquid Galaxy immersive and panoramic Google Earth viewer instances installed around the world are visited daily by school or other kind of groups. The teacher or guide usually will want to show up certain contents. The idea is to develop a backend where you can enter locations in coordinates, for different users, generating the standard XML Point of Interest file of a Liquid Galaxy on a web url. A PW beacon own by the professor or guide will trigger a small hardware arduino or rpi based in a Liquid Galaxy system to download those POIS for a session.  \r\nTo be coded: the multi user backend to enter the POI coordinates and metadata, the hardware script for recognizing a PW url, and the connection to a Liquid Galaxy.   \r\nSkills needed: Python, whatever language you use for the hardware.  \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n### Mentors - Who is going to help you?\r\n\r\n* Andreu Ibañez  \r\nAndreu is a freelancer technologist with 30 years of experience in the IT sector.

He is being supported by the Spain Minister under a 4 year scholarship. He is researching on security in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks and Internet of Things. He belongs to the CryptULL research group devoted to the development of projects on cryptology. He plans to present his Thesis in 2016.  \r\nTopics: Cryptography, Wireless Communications in Vehicular Networks, Authentication in Internet of Things, Trust Algorithms.  \r\nHe is also founder and Lead Organizer in the Google Developer Group Tenerife, from Spain.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Interested?
